 * This interface is made to be used by an iterative approach to do TimeOfImpact calculations.<p>
 * 
 * This interface allows to query for closest points and penetration depth between two (convex) objects
 * the closest point is on the second object (B), and the normal points from the surface on B towards A.
 * distance is between closest points on B and closest point on A. So you can calculate closest point on A
 * by taking <code>closestPointInA = closestPointInB + distance * normalOnSurfaceB</code>.
